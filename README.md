# Battle-Tank-Game
This is an attempt on recreate one of my favorite childhood game, the Classic NES Games: Tank 1990.

This project also serve as a tool for me to learn SDL, cross compilation, and thoroughly tested project with unit tests.

End goal:
+ Work on both Windows and Linux (Raspian).
+ Google Test as a test framework for unit tests.
+ Using conan to handle cross compilation.
